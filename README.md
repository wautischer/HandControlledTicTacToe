# Hand controlled Tic Tac Toe App in React Native with Teachable Model
The concept of this app is straightforward: play Tic Tac Toe using only one hand, where you show numbers 1-3 to the camera. Each move is divided into two intervals of 4 seconds. During the first interval, you display a number between 1 and 3 to select the row, and during the second interval, you show another number to choose the column.
